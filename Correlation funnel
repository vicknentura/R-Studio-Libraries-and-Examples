The Correlation Funnel process uses 3 functions:

Transform the data into a binary format with binarize() - This step prepares semi-processed data for an optimal format (binary) for correlation analysis

Perform correlation analysis using correlate() - This step correlates the “binarized” data (binary features) with the target

Visualize the feature-target relationships using plot_correlation_funnel() - This step produces the visualization from which we can get business insights
